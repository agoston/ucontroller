Just my old and new projects in the microcontroller land.
Some of it is vastly outdated (atmega + arduino), some are a failure (rfm69, never worked properly), some are great (mostly the ESP parts, under nightclock).
Nothing is finished of course :) Remember, this is for fun.

I'm particularly proud of the 'features' in nightclock. Originally started as a, well, nightclock for my night table, it has grown to be a framework and I was even considering a message-passing router mesh (not done in the end, only designed).
