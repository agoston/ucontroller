I'd like to point out two things, though.\r\n\r\na) This was written in March 2017. Now, a year later, the statement \"According to the ESP8266 SDK, you can only sleep for 4,294,967,295 µs, which is about ~71 minutes.\" is no longer true. With ESP8266-Arduino 2.4.1+ you have access to optimized Espressif SDK functions that were introduced in SDK 2.1. Arduino offers `ESP.deepSleepMax()` (https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino/blob/master/cores/esp8266/Esp.cpp#L119) to determine the max value you can pass to `ESP.deepSleep`. You now get roughly 3.5h of deep sleep at a time. However, as this is based on the RTC and since the RTC clock period tends to drift with changes in temperature this varies a bit.\r\nSee https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino/pull/4234 and https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/2c-esp8266_non_os_sdk_api_reference_en.pdf#page=28 (3.3.9. `system_deep_sleep`) for details.\r\n\r\nb) I don't want to spoil the party but before you get all excited about potential energy savings consider this. Energy consumption during WiFi activity is orders of magnitude higher than during deep sleep. Whether deep sleep consumption is 20µs or 200µs really doesn't matter. For overall consumption pretty much the only thing that matters is how long the modem is on (i.e. WiFi activity). So, if you can afford to double the deep sleep interval of your system you get roughly twice the uptime on a single charge.\r\nWe were able to document this at https://thingpulse.com/2018/02/25/esp8266-monitoring-power-consumption/. It also links to a follow-up article about measures/tricks to reduce overall consumption.","userUrl":"https://thingpulse.com","state":"APPROVED","userIp":null,"userReferrer":null,"userAgent":null,"contentAuthorEmail":null,"contentAuthorName":null,"contentCreatedAt":0,"threadId":"0029.0000.0000.0000.0000.0000.0000.0000.0000.0000","replyingTo":null,"parentId":0,"legacyId":0,"extraContext":null,"parent":null},{"id":409235078,"portalId":0,"contentId":0,"contentTitle":"","contentPermalink":null,"collectionId":0,"createdAt":1524162278272,"deletedAt":0,"userName":"Alexandre Verri","firstName":"Alexandre Verri","lastName":"","userEmail":null,"comment":"Have you measured the current during the deep sleep?
